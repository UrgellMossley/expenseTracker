Hello!

This is a short project inspired by an application demoed in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JS course.

A simple expense tracker that allows users to add expenses to their list and this updates the balance in real time.

I've deviated from his UI a little bit, incorporated basic OOP elements, made the app fully responsive and web friendly and aim to add transitions and effcts shortly.

My local storage methods deviate from his too, using a try,catch block which I think is a bit more robust/elegant.

Hope you enjoy and if you have further questions or suggestions, please let me know.

Upcoming features:

- UI optimisations
- Animations
